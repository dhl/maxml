# MaxML

Download, parse and save an XML document to MongoDB

## Install

Make sure you're using {Bundler}[http://bundler.io].

Add `gem "maxml"` to your `Gemfile`.

As your project may depend on a particular version of the `mongo` and/or
`bson_ext` gem, you need to add those to your Gemfile as well.

```ruby
gem 'maxml'
gem 'mongo'
gem 'bson_ext' 
```

## Usage Example

```ruby
# DB defaults to "localhost" for `host` and 27017 for `port`
db_config = {database: "maxml_test", collection: "xmls"}
reddit = MaxML::XML.new("http://www.reddit.com/.rss", db_config)

# Parse the XML into a JSON string
reddit.to_json

# Parse the XML into a Ruby hash
reddit.to_hash

# Return the serialized XML string
reddit.to_s

# Save to DB
reddit.save

```
